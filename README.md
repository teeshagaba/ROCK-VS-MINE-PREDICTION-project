# ROCK-VS-MINE-PREDICTION-project
The **Rock vs Mine Prediction ML Project** aims to build a machine learning model that can classify whether an object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine (metal cylinder). This type of classification is valuable in submarine and naval applications for detecting potential underwater hazards.

### Project Overview:
- **Objective**: To classify sonar returns into two categories: rocks or mines, helping automate and improve the accuracy of underwater object detection.
  
### Steps Involved:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Standardize the data and handle any missing values to prepare it for analysis.
   - Explore patterns in the sonar data to understand the distinguishing features of rocks vs. mines.

2. **Feature Engineering and Selection**:
   - Analyze which frequency patterns or signal characteristics are most useful for distinguishing between rocks and mines.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Train various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) on the dataset.
   - Compare models based on accuracy, precision, and recall to identify the best approach for the task.

4. **Model Evaluation and Optimization**:
   - Fine-tune the modelâ€™s hyperparameters for optimal performance.
   - Evaluate the final model with metrics like confusion matrix, accuracy, and F1-score to ensure robust classification.

### Key Outcomes:
- A machine learning classifier that can accurately distinguish between sonar readings from rocks and mines.
- Insights into sonar signal patterns that are characteristic of mines vs. natural underwater rocks, which could support real-world detection systems.

### Tools:
- **Libraries**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.

This project demonstrates how machine learning can enhance sonar-based classification systems, with applications in naval defense, oceanography, and underwater exploration.
